# Introduction
As most of our teammates are new to New York City, we want to know more about the city. Also, as we are looking forward to having a job in the city, we were interested in finding a safe/good place to live in New York City by data analysis and visualization. The number one concern of living is safety. Living in the United States of America, we can easily hear the news of shootings, and some areas in New York state are infamous for it. Moreover, there are a lot of news on crime in the central Bronx or Brooklyn area. The next concern is the quality of food and buildings in the neighborhood. We want to know which neighborhood has many restaurants with A grade in the sanitary section and buildings with good quality such as no leakage, no bugs. Through the analysis, our group wants to know which neighborhood in New York City is a good place to live by considering the safety around the area, quality of restaurants, and the quality of buildings.
